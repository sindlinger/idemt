Key Shortcuts 
Keyboard shortcuts (also referred to as hotkeys) are keys and their combinations that allow to execute various commands fast and without using menus or toolbars. Keyboard shortcuts can be assigned for calling any element of the Navigator window, except for elements of the Accounts group. In order to assign a combination of keys to an element, the " Set hotkey" command of its context menu should be executed. 

Assigned hotkeys are of higher priorities than predefined ones. For example, initially the "Ctrl+O" combination calls the platform setup window. If call of the "On Balance Volume" indicator is set to the same combination, "Ctrl+O" will not call the platform setup window any more. 

Predefined keyboard shortcuts execute various functions depending on what platform interface window is currently active. Some hotkeys execute certain functions independent of focus.

How to Start the Trading Platform 
After installation, a group of programs of the trading platform is added to the Start menu, and the program shortcut is created on the desktop. Use them to run the platform. 

Two copies of the platform cannot run from the same directory. If you need to run multiple copies at the same time, install the appropriate number of programs in different directories. 

There are two main modes of trading platform start, as well as some additional methods. 

Main Mode # 
Starting from MS Windows Vista, applications installed to Program Files are not allowed to store their data in the installation folder on default. All data should be stored in a separate Windows user directory. 

Thus, if the platform is installed in the Program Files directory and user rights to write to that directory are limited, it is run in the main mode. The main mode is also used in the following situations: 

If the UAC (User Activity Control) system is enabled. 

If remote connection to a computer is used (RDP, Remote Desktop Protocol). 

In this mode, the editable files of the platform are stored in a specific Windows user directory, and the immutable files are stored in Program Files. Immutable files include executables of the platform, of MetaEditor, standard sounds, etc. Editable files are: 

all platform settings, configuration files; 

all the databases (price history); 

platform and expert journals ; 

all profiles. 

All the editable files of the platform are stored in the following directories (depending on the operating system used): 

Microsoft Windows XP SP3: 

C:\Documents and Settings\ username \Application Data\MetaQuotes\Terminal\ instance_id \ 

Microsoft Windows Vista and higher: 

C:\Users\ username \AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Terminal\ instance_id \ 

Here 'C' is the logical drive letter on which Windows is installed, "username" is the account name in the operating system under which the platform has been installed, "instance_id" is a unique identifier generated based on the path to the directory where the platform is installed. 

For quick access to these folders, use the command " Open Data Folder" in the File menu. Each data folder contains a special text file origin.txt. This file contains the path to the platform installation folder, which corresponds to this data directory. 

In the main mode, the catalog where editable files are stored is different for each Windows account. 

A detailed description of the platform file structure and their purpose is given in the appropriate section . 

Portable Mode 
When installed to Program Files, the platform works in the main mode described above on default. All the platform data are stored in a special Windows user directory. However you can force the platform to store its data in the installation folder. To do it, run the platform in the portable mode. To use this mode, start the platform from the command line with the additional /portable key. For example, "C:\Program Files\MyTerminal\terminal.exe /portable". 

To run the platform in the Portable mode, the following conditions must be met: 

If the platform is installed in the Program Files folder, the user must have administrator rights on the computer. In addition, UAC (User Account Control) must be disabled in the operating system. 

If the platform is installed in any other folder, the user must have permission to write data to that folder. 

Running from the Command Line # 
The trading platform can be run manually with predefined parameters. This can be done by using different keys for starting from a command line and alternative configuration files . 

The platform can be run with the keys from the command line. Specify there a path to the executable platform file (path to the file\terminal.exe) and after a space add one or several of the below keys: 

/login:login number — running a platform under a certain account . For example, terminal.exe / login:100000 . 

/config:path to a configuration file — running a platform with an alternative configuration file. For example, terminal.exe /config:c:\myconfiguration.ini . The default configuration file is common.ini . 

/profile:profile name — running the platform with a definite profile . The profile must be pre-created and located in the /profiles/charts/ of the platform. For example, terminal.exe /profile:Euro . 

/portable — set the platform to run in the Portable mode . Running in this mode may be needed if the platform was earlier launched in the main mode . To run the platform in the portable mode, the operating system user requires appropriate permissions. 

If the key assignment is set incorrectly (invalid login, profile name or configuration file), the default value will be used. 

Running with a Custom Configuration File # 
The trading platform can be run with a custom set of parameters. Create your own configuration file based on the default common.ini . To start the platform with a custom configuration file, run the following command in the command line : 

path_to_platform\terminal64.exe /config:c:\myconfiguration.ini 

where "c:\myconfiguration.ini" is the path to the custom configuration file. 

Custom configuration files are used in the "read only" mode during the work of the platform. Changes in settings made from the platform interface are not written to the used custom configuration file. 

The configuration file parameters are divided into several blocks and correspond to the settings on platform configuration window tabs. Below are the most important settings in the configuration file: 

[Common]

Templates and Profiles 

Templates and Profiles 
A template is a set of chart window parameters that can be applied to other charts. The following data can be stored in a template: 

chart type and color; 

color scheme; 

chart scale; 

OHLC line shown or hidden; 

running Expert Advisor and its parameters; 

applied custom and technical indicators and their settings; 

graphical objects; 

separators of days. 

When you apply a template to a chart, settings stored in it are applied to the instrument and timeframe. For example, you can create a template that includes indicators MACD, RSI, and Moving Average, and then use it for other charts. In this case, the chart windows look the same for different symbols and periods. 

Templates are saved as TPL-files in folder \MQL5\Profiles\Templates . The platform provides several predefined names of templates: 

default.tpl — the basic template that us automatically applied when you create a new chart; 

tester.tpl — the template of the chart on which testing results are displayed; 

debug.tpl — the template of the chart created when you start MQL5 application debugging from MetaEditor . 

To create a template with the desired parameters (or modify an existing one), configure the chart and click " Save Template..." in its context menu. 

To share and synchronize templates and profiles between your platforms, use the MQL5 Storage , which is integrated into MetaEditor. You will be able to access them from any computer using your MQL5.community account. 

Actions with Templates 
Click "Templates" in the Chart menu or in the context menu of a chart or click on on the toolbar. 

Templates menu 

Actions with templates 

Creation 
To create a new template click " Save Template...". A new template is created based on the information of the active chart window. 

Modification 
To edit a template, follow the same steps, but instead of a new file name select an existing template. 

Applying 
To apply a template to a chart, select the required file at the bottom of the menu or click "Load Template" to open a template from any other folder. 

Deletion 
To remove a template, click "Remove Template" in the Charts menu or the context menu of the chart. 

Profiles # 
Profiles provide a convenient way of working with groups of charts. The following data can be stored in a profile: 

charts that are open at the moment when you save the profile 

the location and size of these charts; 

templates applied to the charts. 

When a profile is opened, each chart with all its settings is located exactly in the same position where it was during profile saving. All changes in open chart windows are automatically saved in the current profile. The list of all charts of the current profile is available in the Window menu. The name of the current profile is displayed in the status bar and is marked with a tick in the profile control menu. 

A default profile is created during platform installation. Initially, it stores four chart windows of basic currency pairs: EURUSD, USDCHF, GBPUSD and USDJPY. All profiles are stored in a folder \MQL5\Profiles\Charts . 

Chart templates with running Expert Advisors are also saved in profiles, therefore the platform settings provide an option for automatic disabling of Expert Advisors when changing the profile. 

Managing Profiles # 
Click "Profiles" in the File menu , button on the toolbar or click on the name of the current profile in the status bar . 

Profiles menu 

Commands 

Next — switch to the next profile in the list. The same action can be performed using hotkeys "Ctrl+F5"; 

Previous — switch to the previous profile in the list. The same action can be performed using "Shift+F5"; 

Save as — save the current profile with a new name. The new profile is a copy of the current one and becomes active after saving; 

Remove — delete a profile. Clicking on this command opens the menu of existing profiles. Select one of them to delete it. 

The lower part of this menu contains the list of existing profiles. To apply one of them click on it. 

A predefined profile can be assigned to a trade account. Create a profile with the same name as the account number. The predefined profile is applied automatically when you switch to this account. If there is no predefined profile, the current profile remains active. 

The current profile and the default profile (marked as DEFAULT) cannot be deleted.

You will be progressively introduced to the fundamentals of neural networks and their application in algorithmic trading. As you advance, you will build and train your own AI solution, gradually adding new features. In addition to learning MQL5, you will gain Python and OpenCL programming skills and explore integrated matrix and vector methods, which enable the solution of complex mathematical problems with concise and efficient code. 

Articles on the development of trading applications # 
MQL5.community website features an extensive library of articles on MQL4/MQL5 programming . Articles are an excellent guide for creating applications, since they cover a lot of practical tasks involving algorithmic trading. New articles are published every week. 

List of all available articles is displayed directly in MetaEditor. To find the necessary material, use the online search . 

Types of MQL5 Applications # 
Three major types of trading applications are available. 

Expert Advisors 
Expert Advisors are mechanical trading systems that allow complete automation of analytical and trading activities for the efficient operation in the financial markets. They allow to perform prompt technical analysis of price data and control trading activities on the basis of signals received. They also help to strictly follow a trading strategy eliminating emotions. 

All Expert Advisors are stored in the /MQL5/Experts folder of the trading platform. 

Custom Indicators 
Custom Indicators are custom developed technical indicators intended for analyzing price dynamics. Trading tactics and Expert Advisors are developed based on algorithms of indicators. Custom indicators are only used for analyzing symbol price dynamics. Indicators cannot trade and do not have access to charts. 

All indicators are stored in the /MQL5/Indicators folder of the trading platform. 

Scripts 
A script is an application written in MQL5 designed for a single execution of an action. A script can perform both analytical and trading functions. Unlike Advisors , scripts are executed on request. In other words, if an Expert Advisor works almost continuously, a script executes its function and quits. 

All scripts are stored in the /MQL5/Scripts folder of the trading platform. 

Services 
Services enable the use of custom price feeds for the platform and to implement price delivery from external systems in real time, just like it is implemented on brokers' trade servers. Services can also be used to perform other service tasks in the background. 

Unlike Expert Advisors, indicators and scripts, services are not linked to a specific chart. Such applications run in the background and are launched automatically when the terminal is started (unless such an app was forcibly stopped). 

All services are stored under the /MQL5/Services folder of the trading platform. 

Inside folders Experts, Indicators, Scripts and Services, applications can be sorted into subfolders. The structure of their location is displayed in the Navigator window. 

How to Create and Run a Trading Application # 
Click " Create in MetaEditor" in the context menu of the Navigator window in section Expert Advisors, Indicators or Scripts. MetaEditor can also be launched by pressing F4. 

This launches MetaEditor with an automatically opened MQL5 Wizard. Use it to generate the necessary program template to quickly start software development. Let's create a simple script writing a message "Hello world" into the journal . 

In the resulting template, we add the code Print ( "Hello World" ); and compile it by pressing F7 to receive an executable file. The executable file has an extension EX5 and can be run in the trading platform. 

Compilation results are added to the editor log. 

In accordance with the application type, the source code is saved to the folder MQL5\Scripts\. The executable file is created in the same folder. You can now return to the trading platform and run the generated script. 

Specifics of use of automated trading programs are described in section "Expert Advisors and custom indicators" . 

How to Edit a Trading Application # 
To edit a trading robot or a custom indicator, click " Modify" in its context menu in the Navigator window or select it and press Enter. This opens MetaEditor with the source code of the selected indicator. After you have modified the indicator, re-compile it (F7). Otherwise its previous unchanged version will be used in the platform. 

How to Shut Down a Trading Application # 
There are many ways to shut down a trading application in the platform. 

Trading robot 

Custom technical indicator 

Script 

Click "Remove" in the Expert List window; 

Change the chart template ; 

Change the profile , provided that the appropriate option is enabled in the platform settings ; 

Turn off the trading platform; 

Close the chart the Expert Advisor is running on; 

Run another Expert Advisor on the same chart; 

Click " Remove" in the context menu of the Expert Advisor icon on the chart. 

Click " Delete" or " Delete Indicator Window" in the context menu of the indicator; 

Click "Delete" in the Indicator List window; 

Change the chart template ; 

Re-open the chart. 

Click "Remove" in the Expert List window. This window also contains a list of running scripts; 

Change the chart template ; 

Change the profile , provided that the appropriate option is enabled in the platform settings ; 

Change the chart symbol; 

Change the chart timeframe ; 

Turn off the trading platform; 

Close the chart the script is running on; 

Run another script on the same chart; 

Click " Remove" in the context menu of the script icon on the chart. 

If a trading application is running on a chart, it will not be shut down if you delete the appropriate executable file from the Navigator window. 

Disabling Expert Advisors in the trading platform settings does not disable them completely. This operation only prohibits Expert Advisors from trading. 

How to Run a Downloaded File of the MQ5 Source Code # 
If you only have a source code file (*.MQ5), save it in a folder corresponding to the application type: 

For Expert Advisors — /MQL5/Experts 

For indicators — /MQL5/Indicators 

For scripts — /MQL5/Scripts 

To quickly navigate to the trading platform data folder, click " Open data folder" in the File menu. 

To run a file in the trading platform, compile it in the MetaEditor : 

Open MetaEditor by pressing F4. 

In MetaEditor, open the source code file in the Navigator window by a double left-click on the file name. 

Press F7 to compile it. 

This creates an executable *.EX5 file that can be run in the trading platform. 

Source files (*.MQ5) are not displayed in the Navigator window of the trading platform.

Event Handling 
The MQL5 language provides handling of certain predefined events . The functions for handling these events should be defined in an MQL5 program: function name, return type, a set of parameters (if any) and their types should strictly correspond to the description of an event handling function. 

The client terminal event handler uses the return and parameter types to identify functions processing an event. If a certain function has some parameters or a return type not corresponding to the descriptions below, such a function cannot be used for handling an event. 

Function 

Description 

OnStart 

The function is called when the Start event occurs to perform actions set in the script 

OnInit 

The function is called in indicators and EAs when the Init event occurs to initialize a launched MQL5 program 

OnDeinit 

The function is called in indicators and EAs when the Deinit event occurs to de-initialize a launched MQL5 program 

OnTick 

The function is called in EAs when the NewTick event occurs to handle a new quote 

OnCalculate 

The function is called in indicators when the Calculate event occurs to handle price data changes 

OnTimer 

The function is called in indicators and EAs during the Timer periodic event generated by the terminal at fixed time intervals 

OnTrade 

The function is called in EAs during the Trade event generated at the end of a trading operation on a trade server 

OnTradeTransaction 

The function is called in EAs when the TradeTransaction event occurs to process a trade request execution results 

OnBookEvent 

The function is called in EAs when the BookEvent event occurs to process changes in the market depth 

OnChartEvent 

The function is called in indicators and EAs when the ChartEvent event occurs to process chart changes made by a user or an MQL5 program 

OnTester 

The function is called in EAs when the Tester event occurs to perform necessary actions after testing an EA on history data 

OnTesterInit 

The function is called in EAs when the TesterInit event occurs to perform necessary actions before optimization in the strategy tester 

OnTesterDeinit 

The function is called in EAs when the TesterDeinit event occurs after EA optimization in the strategy tester 

OnTesterPass 

The function is called in EAs when the TesterPass even occurs to handle an arrival of a new data frame during EA optimization in the strategy tester 

The client terminal sends incoming events to corresponding open charts. Also, events may be generated by charts ( chart events ) or mql5 programs ( custom events ). Generating graphical object creation/deletion events can be enabled/disabled by setting the CHART_EVENT_OBJECT_CREATE and CHART_EVENT_OBJECT_DELETE chart properties. Each mql5 application and chart have their own queue of events where all newly arrived events are placed. 

A program gets events only from the chart it is running on. All events are handled one after another in the order of their receipt. If the queue already contains the NewTick event or this event is in the processing stage, then the new NewTick event is not added to mql5 application queue. Similarly, if the ChartEvent is already in an mql5 program queue or such an event is being handled, then a new event of this type is not placed into a queue. Timer event handling is processed in the same way – if the Timer event is already in the queue or is being handled, no new timer event is set into a queue. 

Event queues have a limited but sufficient size, so the queue overflow is unlikely for a correctly developed program. When the queue overflows, new events are discarded without being set into a queue. 

It is strongly recommended not to use infinite loops to handle events. Possible exceptions are scripts handling a single Start event. 

Libraries do not handle any events.

File Functions 
This is a group of functions for working with files. 

For security reasons, work with files is strictly controlled in the MQL5 language. Files with which file operations are conducted using MQL5 means cannot be outside the file sandbox. 

There are two directories (with subdirectories) in which working files can be located: 

terminal_data_folder\MQL5\FILES\ (in the terminal menu select to view "File" - "Open the data directory"); 

the common folder for all the terminals installed on a computer - usually located in the directory C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\MetaQuotes\Terminal\Common\Files. 

There is a program method to obtain names of these catalogs using the TerminalInfoString() function, using the ENUM_TERMINAL_INFO_STRING enumeration: 

//--- Folder that stores the terminal data 
string terminal_data_path= TerminalInfoString ( TERMINAL_DATA_PATH ); 
//--- Common folder for all client terminals 
string common_data_path= TerminalInfoString ( TERMINAL_COMMONDATA_PATH ); 

Work with files from other directories is prohibited. 

If the file is opened for writing using FileOpen() , all subfolders specified in the path will be created if there are no such ones. 

File functions allow working with so-called "named pipes". To do this, simply call FileOpen() function with appropriate parameters.
